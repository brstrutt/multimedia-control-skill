Play/pause/skip currently playing media

## About
Control music/videos currently playing on your computer, much like using media control keys on a keyboard. uses the playback control skill as the trigger for play/pause/next/previous commands, which this skill simply passes on to whatever media is active on the local device at the time.

## Examples
* "Next song."
* "Pause."
* "Resume."
* "Last song."
