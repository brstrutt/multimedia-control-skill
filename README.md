Play/pause/skip currently playing media

## About
Control music/videos currently playing on your computer, much like using media control keys on a keyboard. uses the playback control skill as the trigger for play/pause/next/previous commands, which this skill simply passes on to whatever media is active on the local device at the time.

Extra Info: This skill simply translates play/pause/next/etc controls from the playback controls skill into MPRIS2 controls which are supported by a wide array of media players. It only sends commands to one MPRIS2 supported application at a time. Currently it is a bit pot-luck as to which application it controls if there are several running.

## Examples
* "Next song."
* "Pause."
* "Resume."
* "Last song."
